# GitHub stats viewer

This is a pet project of @RedBrogdon, designed to make it easy to see someone's
GitHub activity for a given date range.

In addition to beign useful to me in my current role as an engineering manager,
this app allows me to get hands-on experience with aspects of Flutter that I'm
curious about. For that reason, I actively discourage anyone from filing issues
or submitting pull requests. Feel free to fork it, though, if you'd like to
create your own version!
